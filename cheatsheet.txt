- **Forest**: A dense forest with towering trees. Connects to the pond, river, and deep forest.
- **Deep Forest**: A quiet and mysterious part of the forest. Leads to the clearing and forest.
- **River**: A rushing river with the sound of water filling the air. Connects to the pond, forest, upstream, and mountain path.
